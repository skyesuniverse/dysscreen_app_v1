  "introTitle": "Introduction to Dyslexia",
  "introText1": "Dyslexia is a neurobiological learning disorder that causes problems in both accurate and fluent word recognition, as well as difficulty spelling and decoding words. Dyslexia, sometimes known as reading disability, is caused by specific differences in brain areas responsible for language processing.",
  "introText2": "Dyslexia is not caused by issues with intelligence, hearing, or vision. Most dyslexic children can do well in school with tutoring or a specialized education program. Emotional support is also very crucial.",
  "introText3": "Although there is no cure for dyslexia, early testing and intervention bring the best results. Dyslexia can go undiagnosed for years and not be recognized until adulthood, but it is never too late to seek help.",
  
  "commonSignsAndSymptomsTitle": "Common Signs and Symptomsx",
  "openText": "Dyslexia symptoms might be difficult to detect before a child begins school, but several early warning signs might indicate a problem.

  "mythsAndFactsTitle": "5 Myths and Facts about Dyslexia",
  "introText": "Dyslexia is a complex learning disorder affecting language processing, especially in reading and writing. Despite its widespread recognition, it is often surrounded by myths and misconceptions, leading to misunderstanding and stigma. Let's clarify some common myths:",
  "myth1": "Myth #1: Dyslexia is a sign of low intelligence",
  "fact1": "Fact: Dyslexia doesn't correlate with intelligence, as individuals with dyslexia often have average or above-average intelligence levels. They may have unique strengths in creativity, problem-solving, and visual-spatial reasoning.",
  "myth2": "Myth #2: Dyslexia only affects reading",
  "fact2": "Fact: Dyslexia, a condition characterized by difficulties in reading, can affect other language skills like spelling, writing, and verbal communication. It can also affect phonological awareness, fluency, comprehension, and word retrieval, impacting daily life and academic and professional success.",
  "myth3": "Myth #3: Dyslexia can be outgrown or cured with time",
  "fact3": "Fact: Dyslexia is a lifelong condition that requires appropriate intervention and support to manage difficulties and develop coping strategies. Early identification and intervention are crucial for improving outcomes and minimizing its impact on academic and social functioning. Many individuals with dyslexia lead successful lives.",
  "myth4": "Myth #4: Dyslexia is caused by laziness or lack of effort",
  "fact4": "Fact: Dyslexia is a neurological condition caused by brain structure and function differences, not laziness or motivation. Despite significant effort, dyslexic individuals still face persistent challenges in reading and language processing. Blaming them perpetuates stigma and hinders their efforts to seek support and accommodations.",
  "myth5": "Myth #5: People with dyslexia see letters and words backward",
  "fact5": "Fact: Dyslexia is not a visual impairment, but rather a condition affecting the ability to decode and recognize written words, leading to difficulties in reading fluency, accuracy, and comprehension, primarily due to phonological processing and language skills rather than visual perception.",
  "outroText": "Dispelling myths and misconceptions about dyslexia is essential for fostering understanding, empathy, and support for individuals with the condition. By challenging stereotypes and promoting accurate information, we can create a more inclusive and supportive environment for individuals with dyslexia to thrive and reach their full potential.",
