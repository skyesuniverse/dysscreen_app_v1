    question: 'Is dyslexia considered a form of autism?',
    answer:
        'No, dyslexia and autism are two different conditions. Neurodevelopmental diseases encompass autism spectrum disorder and particular learning disorders (including dyslexia and the other two categories). But they\'re not the same thing. Someone can have both at the same time, but this does not imply that one causes the other.\n\nSimilarly, dyslexia and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are two distinct conditions. ADHD, like autism, is classified as a unique learning condition, and you can have ADHD and dyslexia simultaneously. However, they are independent of each other, thus having both does not imply that one produced the other.',

    question: 'What causes dyslexia?',
    answer:
        'The specific causes of dyslexia are still unknown, but anatomical and brain imaging studies reveal abnormalities in how a dyslexic person\'s brain develops and functions. Furthermore, most people with dyslexia struggle to distinguish the different speech sounds inside a word and/or learn how letters represent those sounds, which is a major contributor to their reading difficulties. Dyslexia is not caused by a lack of intelligence or want to learn; with the right teaching methods, people with dyslexia can learn successfully.',

    question: 'Can students with dyslexia perform well in school?',
    answer:
        'Many dyslexic students do extraordinarily well in school. These students are typically very motivated and work really hard. In many cases, individuals were recognized early and given evidence-based therapies and accommodations, such as extra time on examinations, to demonstrate their understanding. Dyslexic students have completed hard programs at prestigious institutions, graduate, and professional schools.',

    question: 'Can smart people be dyslexic?',
    answer:
        'Some of the brightest children struggle with reading. Dyslexia affects all levels of intelligence, including normal, above average, and highly talented.

  Faqs_QnA(
    question: 'Can individuals who have dyslexia learn to read?',
    answer:
        'Yes. Children with dyslexia who receive adequate phonological awareness and phonics training in kindergarten and first grade will have considerably fewer difficulties learning to read at grade level than children who are not recognised or aided until third grade. 74% of children who are poor readers in third grade are poor readers in the 9th grade, many of whom do not receive adequate Structured Literacy training of the necessary intensity or duration. They frequently struggle to read even as adults. Individuals with dyslexia can learn to read, comprehend, and express information more efficiently at any age. According to research, programmes that use Structured Literacy instructional strategies can assist both children and adults learn to read.',
